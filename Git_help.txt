To upload your image, .pkl file (larger than 100 MB), and .py file to your GitHub repository named myfastai, follow these steps:

Install Git LFS if you haven't already. You can follow the instructions on the official website.

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing your image, .pkl file, and .py file.

Clone your myfastai repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/myfastai
Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username.

Move your image, .pkl file, and .py file into the cloned myfastai folder.

Navigate to the myfastai folder in the terminal:

cd myfastai
Initialize Git LFS:

git lfs install
Track the large .pkl file with Git LFS:

git lfs track "*.pkl"
Add the changes to the .gitattributes file:

git add .gitattributes
Add all the files (image, .pkl, and .py) to the staging area:

git add .
Commit the changes:

git commit -m "Add image, pkl file, and py file"
Push the changes to the remote repository:

git push -u origin main
Now, your image, .pkl file, and .py file should be successfully uploaded to your myfastai GitHub repository using Git LFS for the large .pkl file.
